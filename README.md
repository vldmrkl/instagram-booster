# instagram-booster
Node.js application for increasing the number of Instagram followers by unfollowing and following popular accounts periodically.

# Warning
As of July 2019, after running this program about a week, Instagram sends you a notification about a suspicious activity on your account and asks you to remove your credentials from 3rd-party services. If you don't comply with it, they would either shadowban or block your account.
